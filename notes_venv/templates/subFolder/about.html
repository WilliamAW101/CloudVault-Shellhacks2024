            <p> Cloud vault is a file uploading platform designed to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for managing documents. 
                This application allows users to safely and securely upload a variety of files, including PNG, JPG, and PDF. 
                A robust python script using Flask ensures secure communication between the HTTPS reinforced backend and the user friendly frontend. 
                The docker container running ChainGuardâ€™s WOLFI OS leverages our security systems, ensuring that every uploaded file is handled within a lightweight and secure environment.  
                Cloud Vault mitigates potential risks associated with file uploads, such as malicious content and unrestricted file access, via file type verification and restricted access control.
